The survey form is one of the most straight forward HTML project that a begineer can start. 

In this project, I have created a simple survey form and then submit the information captured. You can open any text editor to write your code, and save your file with .html extension. For example, survey_form.html. 

Every file should start with the <html> tag and end with </html> end tag.
